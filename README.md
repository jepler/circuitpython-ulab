# circuitpython-ulab

ulab is a numpy-like array manipulation library for micropython. 
The module is written in C, defines compact containers for numerical 
data, and is fast.

ulab will be incorporated in builds of most CircuitPython supported
devices, so there's usually no need to use the files here directly.
If you've encountered a problem with circuitpython-ulab, please
file an issue [in the circuitpython issue tracker](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython).

circuitpython-ulab is based on [micropython-ulab](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab).
